I want to give a sense of how the EM algorithm can be used in a variety of
computational biology problems, beyond the common
[mixture of distributions model](EM.html).
Here I will show how EM can be used to find the *sequence motifs*
associated with DNA binding proteins, like transcription factors. A
sequence motif is a series of DNA letters (nucleotides) that the DNA binding
proteins can "recognize". As we discussed in class, when we refer
loosely to such "recognition", we're actually talking about the
protein and the DNA sequence in a particular region having
electrostatic interactions, producing favorable, low energy states. 
Recall the image of the amino acid residuals "reaching in" to the
major and minor groove of the DNA double helix, and interacting with
the 4 possible nucleotides.

The following will be an incredibly oversimplified simulation and
model to show how EM might help us find sequence motifs. For a real
reference on how EM might be used, please consult the following paper,
which proposed an EM-based methodology for motif finding:

*MEME: discovering and analyzing DNA and protein sequence motifs*
[link]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1538909/)

For homework, you will work with ChIP-seq data for a particular
transcription factor with a known motif, and you will try to adapt the
following code to find the motif of this transcription factor from
data.

# Simulation of motif finding

The over-simplifications we will make here, which result in an unrealistic
simulation and worse method, but are useful for pedagogical purposes:

* I will only model the motif sequence itself, and not the
  probability of the "background" sequence.
* Each DNA sequence will be the same length. In reality, we often will
  have experimental data that a protein binds to a location, but each
  genomic range will have a different width.
* Each DNA sequence will contain the motif. With experimental data, a
  number of the locations where we find a protein bound to DNA might
  not contain that protein's motif. It is possible that the protein we
  are interested in is bound to another protein that is bound to DNA,
  so our protein is not making direct contact with DNA through its motif.
* I will only look on one strand of the DNA, instead of on both strands.
* I will simulate identical DNA sequences as the hidden motif,
  although in fact, sequence motifs of a DNA binding protein vary
  across the genome. There are always some, and often many, positions
  within a motif which allow for a variety of nucleotides.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

I begin by defining some parameters and simulating our motif that we
want to find. Here I use numbers 1-4 to represent nucleotides A,C,G,T.

```{r}
n <- 300 # number of DNA sequences
l <- 100 # number of nucleotides for each sequence
motif.len <- 10 # the length of the true motif
set.seed(5)
motif <- sample(1:4, motif.len, TRUE)
motif
```

Now we will embed the motif into some DNA sequences, which here are
rows of a matrix *X*. The *Z* variable keeps track of the start
position of the motif in the DNA sequences in *X*. We therefore setup
a problem that can be tackled with EM: if we knew the motif, we could
find the locations *Z*, and if we knew the locations *Z*, we could
easily determine the motif. We start with neither.

Before we get started, note that EM is not the only way to find these
motifs. Another, seemingly more direct approach, would be to tabulate
all the k-mers for a value of k that is large, but less than the
length of the motif we are looking for. If we look across sequences
which should occasionally contain the motif, we will likely find sets
of k-mers that occur more than we would expect in "background" DNA
sequences. 

```{r}
x <- matrix(sample(1:4, n * l, TRUE),nrow=n)
z <- sample(l - motif.len + 1, n, TRUE)
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
  x[i, z[i] + 0:(motif.len-1)] <- motif
}
head(z)
x[1,]
x[1,z[1] + 0:(motif.len-1)]
motif
```

Finally, we describe the parameters $\theta$ we will use to describe
the motif. We will specify a matrix which has four rows for each of
the DNA nucleotides, and is wider than the motif itself. This
extension of the size of the matrix will reduce the chance that we
hit upon the motif, but some of the nucleotides in the motif fall
outside of the nucleotides modeled in $\theta$. A column of the matrix
$\theta$ will represent the probability of observing a given
nucleotide (A,C,G,T down the rows) at a given position in the
motif. Note again that the positions in the motifs we recover are
arbitrarily shifted: if the true motif starts at position 3 or
position 7 of $\theta$ will both get us to a local maximum of the log
likelihood. 

```{r}
set.seed(5)
theta.len <- 20
theta <- matrix(runif(theta.len*4),ncol=theta.len)
theta <- sweep(theta, 2, colSums(theta), "/")
dim(theta)
theta[,1:5]
```

Let's first step through one iteration before we run the EM
algorithm. We start by calculating the conditional probabilities using
X and our initial guess $\theta^0$. We store these in a matrix, with
one row per DNA sequence, and as many columns as potential starting
positions for the motif. As I said above, for simplicity, here we just
focus on the probability of the motif sequence, and ignore the
background sequence. Let's just calculate the first row, i=1, and the
first position, p=1.

```{r}
i <- 1
p <- 1
# move a window along row i of x
snip <- x[i,p + 0:(theta.len-1)]
snip
# calculate the conditional probability given X and current theta
prod(theta[1,snip == 1]) * prod(theta[2,snip == 2]) *
  prod(theta[3,snip == 3]) * prod(theta[4,snip == 4])
```

Once we've stored these condition probabilities in a matrix, `z.mat`,
we can use these to maximize our expectation of the log
likelihood with respect to the condition distribution of *Z* given *X* and $\theta^t$ 
and then update to $\theta^{t+1}$. We will add the contribution from each
sequence out of `n`, and from all positions `p`. As `z.mat` will be
normalized so that each row sums to 1 (it forms a density along the
positions), we only need to normalize the contribution of each
sequence and position by `n`. Our update for $\theta^{t+1}$ for each
nucleotide is the weighted average of the number of times we saw that
nucleotide at that position. Here we show the line of code, but it is
not evaluated, as we haven't yet computed `z.mat`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
1/n * z.mat[i,p] * (x[i,p + 0:(theta.len-1)] == j)
```

Now we will put these two pieces together, within a loop. We will also add some
code which will plot the guesses at each iteration.

First define a function to draw the estimates at each iteration, *t*:

```{r}
drawTheta <- function(theta, t) {
  theta.max <- apply(theta, 2, which.max)
  theta.max.p <- apply(theta, 2, max)
  cols.alpha <- sapply(1:theta.len, function(i) {
    adjustcolor(cols[theta.max[i]],(theta.max.p[i] - .25)/.75)
  })
  points(seq_len(theta.len), rep(t,theta.len), col=cols.alpha, pch=15, cex=2)
}
```

The following code chunk is too long for an Rmarkdown, but I put it here as
one long chunk so that you can step through the code at each iteration
and examine the values of Z and theta, as the EM is progressing. It has to
be one long chunk to draw the iterations on the same plot.

```{r message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
theta <- matrix(runif(theta.len*4),ncol=theta.len)
theta <- sweep(theta, 2, colSums(theta), "/")

library(rafalib)
niter <- 10
nullplot(0, theta.len, -1, niter,
         xlab="position in motif", ylab="iterations")
cols <- c("green3","blue","orange","red")
# draw the true motif at the bottom
points(seq_len(motif.len) + (theta.len-motif.len)/2, 
       rep(-1,motif.len), col=cols[motif], pch=15, cex=2)
drawTheta(theta, 0) # draw theta^0

### the EM algorithm ###
for (t in seq(1,niter)) {
  # initialize conditional distribution of Z
  z.mat <- matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=l-theta.len+1)
  for (i in seq_len(n)) {
    for (p in seq_len(l-theta.len+1)) {
      # move a window along row i of x
      snip <- x[i,p + 0:(theta.len-1)]
      # calculate the conditional distribution of Z given X and current theta
      z.mat[i,p] <- prod(theta[1,snip == 1]) * prod(theta[2,snip == 2]) *
        prod(theta[3,snip == 3]) * prod(theta[4,snip == 4])
    }
  }
  # normalize z.mat to make it a density along positions
  z.mat <- z.mat / rowSums(z.mat)
  
  Sys.sleep(0.1)
  # image(z.mat)
  # plot(z, apply(z.mat, 1, which.max), ylab="max density in z.mat")
  # abline(0,1)
  
  # re-estimate theta by maximizing over E_{Z|X,theta^t} (log lik)
  theta <- matrix(0,nrow=4,ncol=theta.len)
  for (j in 1:4) {
    for (i in seq_len(n)) {
      for (p in seq_len(l-theta.len+1)) {
        # for nucleotide j, add the contribution of sequence i,
        # averaging over all positions p, weighted by Z.
        # MLE is just the frequency of when the sequence = j here
        theta[j,] <- theta[j,] + 1/n * z.mat[i,p] * (x[i,p + 0:(theta.len-1)] == j)
      }
    }
  }
  
  drawTheta(theta, t) # theta for iteration 't'
  
}
```

Looking at the estimates of $\theta$ over iterations, we see that the
random initialization contained four positions that aligned with the
true motif. Over the next three iterations, the motif filled in, as
the density in *Z* concentrated on the true positions. Finally, after
iteration 5, we see the motif come into strong relief, with the other
positions evening out to equal probability of all nucleotides.

```{r}
round(theta, 2)
```

Note that, the four nucleotides are not in equal abundance in
"background" sequence in our genomes, and so a better motif finding
method would additionally model the "background" sequence.

We can also see that the positions with highest density in *Z*
correspond linearly to the true locations (although with a shift).
Note that we did not locate the motif for every sequence. In
particular, when the motif started on the far left or far right side,
the $\theta$ matrix was too wide.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
plot(z, apply(z.mat, 1, which.max), ylab="max density in z.mat")
abline(0,1)
```
