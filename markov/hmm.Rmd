Here we will present the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and apply it to
detect copy number variants in *arrayCGH* data. Array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) is a microarray technology which
compares, at a set of regions tiling the genome, the amount of DNA
from a sample compared to a reference. Glossing over the technological
details, if the signal is around 0 it means the sample has the same
number of copies of DNA as the reference; consistent stretches of
higher or lower values than 0 indicate amplifications and deletions,
respectively. Let's dive in a take a look. We load an arrayCGH dataset
from a Bioconductor package, DNAcopy. (Aside: DNAcopy implements
another useful signal processing algorithm, called *circular binary
segmentation*. If we have time we will also cover this algorithm.)

> We selected a subset of the data set presented in Snijders et
> al. (2001). We are calling this data set coriell. The data correspond

If we draw all the values, lined up along the genome, it looks like this:

```{r}
library(DNAcopy)
data(coriell)
plot(coriell$Coriell.05296)
```

One can clearly see two amplifications and one deletion by eye. There
are also many stray points, which are likely just noise. The authors
of the DNAcopy have a simple method to smooth away the singleton
points. We ignore the warning about repeated positions...

```{r}
cna <- CNA(cbind(coriell$Coriell.05296),
           coriell$Chromosome,coriell$Position,
           data.type="logratio", sampleid="c05296")
smo <- smooth.CNA(cna)
y <- smo$c05296
y <- y[!is.na(y)]
plot(y)
```

As I said previously, we can clearly identify the three regions that
correspond to large variants in this dataset. So why do we need to
use a sophisticated model? A couple of reasons: (1) we would like to
have an automated procedure, so we don't have to check such plots by
eye. Always imagine, suppose the dataset grows from one sample to
10,000 samples. Will the check-by-eye procedure still work? (2)
Suppose the samples have different noise level. We want a procedure
which works fairly well for various signal-to-noise ratios. Even given
the current, fairly high signal-to-noise data, we cannot simply draw a
line to separate, for example, the amplification in the middle of the
sequence. If we try a line roughly in between, it works for the local
region, but would also call lots of singletons outside of the region,
as shown in the following two plots.

```{r}
plot(y, xlim=c(1080,1220))
abline(h=.25)
plot(y)
abline(h=.25)
```

# Markov Models

One intuitive model for segmenting this data into regions is the
Hidden Markov Model (HMM). If you haven't yet seen 
[Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Formal_definition),
they are very useful and not too hard to understand. An order-1 Markov
chain is a sequence, $X_1, X_2, ...$ such that the probability the
chain is in a given state at time *t* given all of the previous time
points is equal to the probability the chain is in that state at time
*t* given the only the *t-1* time point. We can discard all the
information before time *t-1* and still have the complete information
for knowing the probabilities the chain will be in a given state at
time *t*.

A Hidden Markov Model then consists of a Markov chain, which we do not
observe directly. The chain has some discrete set of states, and some
probabilities for transitioning from one state to another. At time
*t*, we write that the hidden chain is in state *i* by writing $X_t = i$.
Instead of $X_t$, what we observe is an outcome $Y_t = y_t$, and the
probability density function for $Y_t$ will depend on which state
$X_t$ is in. The most common formulation is that $Y_t$ also takes on
discrete values, but here we will have $Y_t$ take on continuous
values, with Normal distributions indexed by *i*.

As a reference, we note that the following paper proposed an HMM to
segment arrayCGH data, although we will use different notation, and a
more simple HMM approach here.

[Hidden Markov models approach to the analysis of array CGH data](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X04000260) - Fridlyand et al

The key components to modeling data as an HMM are: a starting
distribution $\pi$ for $X_1$ over the states, a transition matrix *A*,
with entries $A_{i,j}$ indicating the probability that *X* will
transition from state *i* to state *j* in one step in the chain, and
the emission probabilities *B*. If *Y* takes on discrete values, then
*B* can be represented as a matrix, but here we will write $B_{i,y_t}$
to be the value of a density evaluated at $y_t$ using a series of
probability density functions indexed by *i*. This can be seen clearly
in the code below. We specify three states for *X*: `n=3`. We will
encapsulate all variables as $\theta = (\pi, A, B)$.

The final line in the code chunk below only makes sense for this
particular application, where we enforce a probability of 0 for
transitioning from state 1 to 3 or vice versa. This means that, we
expect the chain will go first to state 2 (normal copy number).

```{r}
T <- length(y)
n <- 3
pi <- rep(1/n, n) # equal starting probabilities
A <- matrix(.01, nrow=n, ncol=n) # the transition matrix
diag(A) <- .99 # high density on diagonal usually stay in same state
A[2,2] <- .98
A[1,3] <- A[3,1] <- 0 # only makes sense for CNV here
rowSums(A)
A
```

The following encodes the emission probabilities. Note that we make
some really bad guesses for the means of the three probability density
functions. We do this on purpose, to show the improvement when we
later use the HMM to update these parameters 
using the [EM algorithm](../model/EM.html).

```{r}
mu <- c(-.4,0,.4) # bad guesses! to show improvement later
sigma <- rep(.1, n)
B <- function(j, y) {
  dnorm(y,mu[j],sigma[j])
}
```

# Useful variables for analyzing the HMM

Here we will use the definitions of variables from 
[An Introduction to hidden Markov models](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1165342)
by Lawrence Rabiner and Biing-Hwang Juang. We use a small notation
change, using *Y* for the observed variables and *X* for the hidden
variables instead of *O* and *I*, as it is difficult to see the
difference between *I* and the condition bar. The *Y* and *X* notation
can be found on the Wikipedia page for the 
[Baum-Welch algorith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm).

The following variables denote (with phrasing from Rabiner and Juang):

* $\alpha_{i,t}$ - the probability of the partial observation sequence until time *t*
and state *i*, given the model $\theta$
* $\beta_{i,t}$ - the probability of the partial observation sequence
  from *t+1* to the end, given state *i* and the model $\theta$
* $\gamma_{i,t}$ - the probability of state *i* at time *t* given the
  entire observation sequence and the model $\theta$
  
It's useful to see these as formula:

$$ \alpha_{i,t} = P(Y_1=y_1,...,Y_t=y_t,X_t=i|\theta) $$

$$ \beta_{i,t} = P(Y_{t+1}=y_{t+1},...,Y_T=y_T|X_t=i,\theta) $$

$$ \gamma_{i,t} = P(X_t=i|Y,\theta) $$

Note that the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ do not have a correspondence to the
A and B matrices, these are just the fairly universal symbols that are
used for the forward and backward probabilities, and the transition
and emission matrices. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will include both A and B
in their calculation.

The magic of the HMM is that, we can calculate these probabilities
quite efficiently using *dynamic programming*, and relying on the
key property of the Markov chain. If we consider $\alpha_{i,t}$, we
need only to examine the probabilities at time *t-1* to evaluate the
probabilities at time *t*. All of the information about the chain that
we need to calculate probabilities at time *t* is encoded in the
probabilities one step behind in time. And likewise for $\beta_{i,t}$,
but running time forward instead of backward. These two sets of
equations are called the 
[Forward-Backward algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward%E2%80%93backward_algorithm).

Let's step through how we will calculate each column of $\alpha_{i,t}$.
We start with the initial probabilities $\pi$, and the
observed value $Y_1 = y_1$. Then at time *t=2* and for state *i*, we
take the sum of the following vector: 
the pre-computed probabilities from all possible states at time *t=1*,
multiplied by the probability of transitioning to state *i*, and then
multiplied by the probability of having observed $Y_2 = y_2$.
Because of the Markov property, we can repeat this step until the end
of the sequence, only looking back one time point at each step. This
property, of only having to look back at the previous stage to know
how to move forward, is part of
[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming).
Typical dynamic programs use this efficiency to calculate, for example, the 
[shortest path through a graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
by first solving the shortest path through a smaller part of the graph.

```{r}
alpha <- matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=T)
alpha[,1] <- pi * B(1:n,y[1])
for (t in 2:T) {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    alpha[i,t] <- sum(alpha[,t-1] * A[,i]) * B(i,y[t])
  }
  alpha[,t] <- alpha[,t] / sum(alpha[,t]) # scale to 1 to prevent small probs
}
```

We can see the same pattern at work for $\beta_{i,t}$

```{r}
beta <- matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=T)
beta[,T] <- 1
for (t in (T-1):1) {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    beta[i,t] <- sum(beta[,t+1] * A[i,] * B(1:n,y[t+1]))
  }
  beta[,t] <- beta[,t] / sum(beta[,t])
}
```

Finally, note that we can obtain $\gamma_{i,t}$ using $\alpha_{i,t}$
and $\beta_{i,t}$.

$$ \gamma_{i,t} = P(X_t=i|Y,\theta) $$

$$ = \frac{P(X_t=i,Y|\theta)}{P(Y|\theta)} $$ 

$$ = \frac{P(Y_1=y_1,...,Y_t=y_t,X_t=i|\theta) P(Y_{t+1}=y_{t+1},...,Y_T=y_T|X_t=i,\theta)}{P(Y|\theta)} $$

```{r}
gamma <- alpha * beta
gamma <- t( t(gamma) / colSums(gamma) )
```

This is interesting to plot, the probability that we are in a given
state at a given time point. Note that this does not tell us the most
likely path of states, which is described below.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(3,3,3,1))
plot(y, xlab="", ylab="", main="data: X_t")
plot(seq_len(T), gamma[2,], type="l", xlab="", ylab="",
     main="P(X_t = state 2 | Y, theta)")
```

# The Viterbi sequence

The Viterbi sequence can be used to give the most likely path of
states. We write $V_{i,t}$ as the probability of the most probable
sequence up to *t*, having *i* as its final state. While we calculate
these probabilities of most probable sequences, we will also keep
another variable *Ptr* which points us back along that path.

```{r}
V <- matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=T)
V[,1] <- pi * B(1:n,y[1])
Ptr <- matrix(0,nrow=n,ncol=T)
for (t in 2:T) {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    V[i,t] <- max(V[,t-1] * A[,i]) * B(i,y[t])
    Ptr[i,t] <- which.max(V[,t-1] * A[,i])
  }
  V[,t] <- V[,t] / sum(V[,t])
}
```

Once we are done, we can run backwards from *T* to *1*, and
re-construct the most probably sequence of states, here stored as
`x.hat`. 

```{r}
x.hat <- numeric(T)
x.hat[T] <- which.max(V[,T])
for (t in (T-1):1) {
  x.hat[t] <- Ptr[x.hat[t+1],t+1]
}
```

Note that, even though we had pretty bad guesses for the mean values,
we still accurately segment the amplifications and deletions, apart
from the normal copy number state.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,1),mar=c(3,3,3,1))
plot(y, xlab="", ylab="", main="data: X_t")
plot(seq_len(T), x.hat, type="l", xlab="", ylab="",
     main="The Viterbi sequence")
```

# Updating parameters: the Baum-Welch algorithm

Finally, we show the algorithm used for updating our estimates of the
parameters $\theta = (\pi,A,B)$, which is called the
[Baum-Welch algorith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm),
a special case of the [EM algorithm](../model/EM.html). 

We already have all we need to update $\pi$ and the parameters of B,
but we need to define a new variable to give us the conditional
probabilities of transitions given our current estimates for the model $\theta$.

We define a variable, $\xi_{i,j,t}$ as the probability of a path being in
state *i*, and transitioning to state *j* at time *t+1*, given the
observation sequence and the estimates for $\theta$.

$$ \xi_{i,j,t} = P(X_t=i,X_{t+1}=j|Y,\theta) $$

$$ = \frac{\alpha_{i,t} A_{i,j} B_{j,y_{t+1}} \beta_{j,t+1}}{P(Y|\theta)} $$ 

We can compute these probabilities, for all *i,j,t*, using the Forward
algorithm, multiplying one set of transition probabilities with *A*,
an emission probability with *B*, followed by the Backward
algorithm. As shown above, all of these values are already available,
we just need to iterate through all the values for *i,j,t*, and then
scale appropriately. 

```{r}
xi <- array(0, dim=c(n,n,T-1))
for (t in seq_len(T-1)) {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    for (j in 1:n) {
      xi[i,j,t] <- alpha[i,t]*A[i,j]*B(j,y[t+1])*beta[j,t+1]
    }
  }
  xi[,,t] <- xi[,,t] / sum(xi[,,t])
}
```

Finally, we can update parameters in the M step by maximizing their
values using $\gamma_{i,t}$ and $\xi_{i,j,t}$ as the conditional
probabilities for the chain of states and transitions. For means and
variances, we use weighted sample mean and weighted sample variance
calculations. If *Y* took discrete values, we would just count up the
number of times it took each value, weighted by the probability for a
given state.

```{r}
pi.hat <- gamma[,1]
A.hat <- apply(xi, c(1,2), sum) / rowSums(gamma[,-T])
mu.hat <- rowSums(t(t(gamma) * y)) / rowSums(gamma)
sigma.hat <- sapply(1:n, function(i) {
  sqrt(sum(gamma[i,] * (y - mu.hat[i])^2) / sum(gamma[i,]))
})
```

We can see how we did with our new estimates for $\mu$, which are
greatly improved. Note that, we could improve even more by specifying
a fourth state for the amplification on the far right.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
palette(brewer.pal(2*n, "Paired"))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(y, col=x.hat * 2 - 1)
abline(h=mu, col=1:n * 2, lwd=3)
plot(y, col=x.hat * 2 - 1)
abline(h=mu.hat, col=1:n * 2, lwd=3)
```

Our initial guess for $\sigma$ has also been improved, see how close
it is to the variance of the *y* values for the normal copy number state.

```{r}
sigma
sigma.hat[2]
sd(y[x.hat == 2])
```

Finally, the transition probabilities also make sense, and roughly
correspond to what we would expect given the length of the runs in the
predicted segmentation: the run length for state *i* can be considered a 
[geometric random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution)
with success probability $A_{i,i}$.

```{r}
sum(x.hat == 1)
1/A.hat[1,2]
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
