Previously, we looked at distances between samples in high-throughput
sequencing experiments, exploring sequencing depth as a technical
artifact, the effect of various transformation on stabilizing
variance, and PCA and hierarchical clustering as methods for
ordination of samples.

In [distances](distances.html), we noticed many genes where
we see differences in measurements across the sequencing center, and
in [hclust](hclust.html), we saw high level clustering of samples by
sequencing center, when we focused on a single human population. These
technical differences in high-throughput measurements are often
referred to as "batch effects", a term which encompasses any kind of
technical artifact due to the lab or time at which a sample was
processed. Note that the time of sample preparation, the *batch*, can
have its own unique technical distortion on measurements, just as much
as a sample from a different sequencing center. 

Two references which give a general outline of batch effects in
sequencing data are:

* [Tackling the widespread and critical impact of batch effects in high-throughput data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3880143/)
* [Analyzing and minimizing PCR amplification bias in Illumina sequencing libraries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3188800/)

It is critical, if you are involved in the design of a high-throughput
experiment, that the biological conditions are not *confounded* with
the sample preparation batches, instead to use either a block or
randomized design. Block designs are easy, simply ensuring that each
sample preparation batch contains each of the biological conditions of
interest, so that the batch effects can be isolated apart from the
biological differences between samples.

Here I will show the origin of batch effects across lab can sometimes
be isolated to batch-specific distortions related to the DNA sequence
of the genes. As described in the second link above, a step in nearly
all high-throughput experiments is to amplify the DNA fragments
using [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction). 
As PCR is an exponential process of copying molecules, it is very
sensitive to slight variations, and results in distortions of
measurements which are specific to the particular place and time when
the samples were processed: the batch.

We start again with the GEUVADIS RNA-seq samples prepared
in [distances](distances.html). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
load("geuvadis.rda")
```

As typical, though we conceptually have a simple task to perform, many
steps are needed just to get the covariates that we need. Here our
simple task is to model the counts on covariates like the genes'
lengths and sequence content. However, it will take many steps to
obtain and summarize the sequence content into a single number. 

A critical summary of DNA sequence is the *GC content*, which is the
fraction of G's and C's out of the total sequence. Note that, because
G pairs with C, and C with G, the GC content of a sequence and it's
complement is identical. GC content varies along the genome, for
biological reasons. Different organisms have very different GC content
of their genomes. But we care about GC content also for a technical
reason: because the GC content of a piece of DNA can make it
difficulty to amplify. We will see this below. 

In order to get the GC content of each gene, we start by downloading
the information about the genes used by recount2 for quantification,
which was version 25 of the Gencode genes. We download this file from
the following
[link](ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/gencode/Gencode_human/release_25/gencode.v25.annotation.gtf.gz).

```{r message=FALSE}
library(GenomicFeatures)
```

We need to import this gene information from a GTF (gene transfer
format) file, and turn it into a *TxDb*.
We then save the database, so we can skip the `makeTxDbFromGFF` step
in the future.
Note that a warning message about closing connection is OK.

```{r eval=FALSE}
txdb <- makeTxDbFromGFF("gencode.v25.annotation.gtf.gz")
saveDb(txdb, file="gencode.sqlite")
```

We load the *TxDb* and extract all the exons, grouped by gene. We
check that we have the same gene names in `ebg` and in `dds`.

```{r}
txdb <- loadDb("gencode.sqlite")
ebg <- exonsBy(txdb, by="gene")
head(names(ebg))
table(names(ebg) %in% rownames(dds))
table(rownames(dds) %in% names(ebg))
```

Note that the exons in `ebg` contain redundant sequence. We can see
this by plotting the ranges for a given gene. Note that, after running
`reduce`, we remove all redundant sequence in `ebg` for a given gene.

```{r message=FALSE}
e <- ebg[[1]]
library(rafalib)
plotRanges <- function(e) {
  l <- length(e)
  r <- ranges(range(e))
  nullplot(start(r), end(r), 0, l+1)
  segments(start(e), 1:l, end(e), 1:l, lwd=5)
}
plotRanges(e)
plotRanges(reduce(e))
ebg.red <- reduce(ebg)
```

Now we extract the exonic sequence for every gene, using
the `extractTranscriptSeqs` function. We then calculate the GC content
with `letterFrequency`, and assign this to a `gc` column of
`ebg.red`. Finally, we find a matching between the rownames of `dds`
and `ebg.red`, and assign the GC content and length of genes from
`ebg.red` to `dds`. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)
dna <- extractTranscriptSeqs(Hsapiens, ebg.red)
all(sum(width(ebg.red)) == width(dna))
mcols(ebg.red)$gc <- as.numeric(letterFrequency(dna, "GC", as.prob=TRUE))
m <- match(rownames(dds), names(ebg.red))
all(m == seq_along(m)) # they happen to be in order
mcols(dds)$gc <- mcols(ebg.red)$gc[ m ]
mcols(dds)$len <- sum(width(ebg.red))[ m ]
```

We know have all the covariates we need for modeling how the counts
vary by GC content. We can make simple plots to see if we see a
dependence. Note that, outside of GC content of .35-.65, we see very
few large counts, although there do appear to be genes with this GC
content. It is very difficult to amplify the fragments of cDNA from
these genes, and so they are often missing from high-throughput
sequencing experiments like RNA-seq.

```{r}
plot(mcols(dds)$gc, log10(counts(dds)[,1]+1), cex=.1)
abline(v=c(.35,.65))
```

We also plot the counts over the length of the gene. It is expected
that, everything else being equal, we should see higher counts from
longer genes. Keep in mind though, that we do not expect a line in
this scatterplot, due to differences in gene expression of the genes
at a given length. In other words, any point on the x-axis, the
differences in a vertical band can be explained by gene expression (as
well as any other technical covariates, like GC content).

```{r}
plot(log10(mcols(dds)$len), log10(counts(dds)[,1]+1), cex=.1)
```

We will know use a Bioconductor package called 
[cqn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/22285995/)
to model systematic dependence of counts on gene GC content and
length. We provide the `cqn` function with the counts, the GC content
and the gene lengths. The plots show estimated spline dependence of
counts on GC (`n=1`)...

```{r message=FALSE}
library(cqn)
idx <- dds$population == "TSI"
dds2 <- dds[,idx]
cts <- counts(dds2)
fit <- cqn(cts, mcols(dds2)$gc, mcols(dds2)$len)
cqnplot(fit, n=1)
```

...and dependence on length (`n=2`).

```{r}
cqnplot(fit, n=2, xlim=c(-2,4.5))
```

Both of these plots are typical: for GC content, we see an upside-down
"U", where the low and high GC content fragments are systematically
underrepresented (although we see lots of sample-sample variability in
the estimated splines). And it is typical to have more counts for
longer genes due to fragmentation. The tick marks on the x-axis
indicate the knots of the splines, by default, these are data
quantiles: 0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975.

We can draw the lines with the sequencing center as the color. Doing
this, we see that the lines cluster by sequencing center. The
dependence of counts on the GC content of the features being sequenced
is highly batch specific.

```{r}
library(rafalib)
bigpar()
center <- dds2$center
cqnplot(fit, n=1, col=center)
legend("bottom", levels(center), fill=1:nlevels(center))
```

There is less variation of counts on gene length across center:

```{r}
cqnplot(fit, n=2, col=center, xlim=c(-2,4.5))
legend("topleft", levels(center), fill=1:nlevels(center))
```


Finally, we zoom in to two sequencing centers, to show how different
the dependence of counts on GC content can be across batch. You can
also cross reference this final plot with Figure 2 
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5143225/), which
goes into more depth on the topic.

```{r}
idx <- dds$population == "TSI" & dds$center %in% c("CGR","UG")
dds3 <- dds[,idx]
cts <- counts(dds3)
fit <- cqn(cts, mcols(dds3)$gc, mcols(dds3)$len)
center <- droplevels(dds3$center)
cqnplot(fit, n=1, col=center)
legend("bottom", levels(center), fill=1:nlevels(center))
```
