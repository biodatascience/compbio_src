article on Wikipedia:

# Setup

We observe $X$, and have some idea about the relationship of the
variance to the mean $$
\begin{align}
E(X) &= \mu \\
\text{Var}(X) &= h(\mu)
\end{align}
$$

Suppose for a moment we are looking at data independent of any
covariate like condition or batch, so it's just simple random variable
$X$.

We are interested in modeling this data but with a constant variance
assuption. Maybe we want to do something with a linear part to the
mean but don't want to incorporate that variance would depend on the
mean.

So we would like to have

$$
\text{Var}(X) = C
$$

Consider a (differentiable) transformation $g$ of $X$, so write

$$
Y = g(X)
$$

And maybe we can obtain

$$
\text{Var}(Y) \approx C
$$

Note that a first order Taylor expansion of $X$ around $E(X)$ gives:

$$
Y = g(X) \approx g(E(X)) + g'(E(X))(X - E(X))
$$

The delta method uses this to derive asymptotic distributions of
transformed variables:

$$
\begin{align}
E(Y) &\approx g(E(X)) \\
\text{Var}(Y) &\approx \text{Var(X)} g'(E(X))^2
\end{align}
$$

Add in what we know about $\text{Var}(X)$ and use $\mu$ notation to
simplify

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Var}(Y) &\approx h(E(X)) g'(E(X))^2 \\
\text{Var}(Y) &\approx h(\mu) g'(\mu)^2
\end{align}
$$

If we want this to be constant we can solve for $g$:

$$
\frac{dg}{d\mu} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{h(\mu)}}
$$

Then we define our approximate VST as:

$$
g(\mu) = \int \frac{C d\mu}{\sqrt{h(\mu)}}
$$

In other words, integrating the inverse square root of the variance
mean relationship should provide data that roughly has constant
variance.
