# Question 1 - Direct modeling of technical bias using splines

In the first question, you will implement something roughly
approximating the direct modeling approach of CQN, and then in the
second question you will compare your estimates to those given by
CQN. The purpose of what we are doing is to find systematic trends in
the counts of sequenced reads on attributes of the features (genes)
including their basepair composition (GC content) and their length
(number of basepairs). We have reason to believe that such trends
may reflect technical variation not representative of the underlying
proportion of RNA. When such trends differ across samples, these can
lead to distortions and bias in inference making use of the raw
counts.

We will use the Bottomly RNA-seq experiment data that we showed
the `sva.Rmd`, although here we will use a version of the dataset that
is already prepared as a SummarizedExperiment, and so it already has a
GRangesList associated with the rows. This will make it easier to get
the GC content and length of the genes.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
```

We download the SummarizedExperiment object `bottomly.rda` from:

<https://github.com/mikelove/bottomly>

You can either go to the repo URL, and click on the *Download* button,
or use the code chunk below:

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/mikelove/bottomly/raw/main/bottomly.rda"
file <- "bottomly.rda"
if (!file.exists(file)) download.file(url, file)
```

We have a data object with `counts` across 37,991 genes and 21
samples:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
load("bottomly.rda")
bottomly
```

Next we reduce the `rowRanges` so that we only have unique exon
sequence associated with each row of the SummarizedExperiment, as was
seen in the batch effects lecture note.

```{r}
rowRanges(bottomly) <- reduce(rowRanges(bottomly))
```

For convenience, we want to use the Bioconductor genome package
`BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm9`, which lines up with the `rowRanges` of
our SummarizedExperiment, however, we will need to remove some genes
which are listed on chromosomes that are not present in this
genome. We also need to change the style of the sequence names from
"NCBI" to "UCSC" to use the genome above.

```{r}
library(GenomeInfoDb)
bottomly <- keepStandardChromosomes(bottomly, pruning.mode="coarse")
seqlevelsStyle(rowRanges(bottomly)) <- "UCSC"
seqinfo(rowRanges(bottomly))
```

Now you should be ready to extract the GC content and length of the
genes, as was done in `batch.Rmd`. Remember, you already have the
*reduced* exon ranges associated with each gene stored as `rowRanges`
of the SummarizedExperiment. As in the lecture note, the GC content
and length of the gene are defined here as the ratio of G or C over
the number of basepairs, and the total number of basepairs, of the
*reduced* exon ranges. We do not therefore count overlapping exon
sequence twice.

Once you have the GC content and length of each gene, make a
`data.frame` with one column for the GC content, and then three columns of
counts from three samples, picking one sample from each batch. We
won't use the gene length yet.

You can use `which(bottomly$batch == "b4")`, for example, to find out
which samples come from each batch. So the `data.frame` should have
four columns in the end.

Finally, fit three Poisson generalized linear models to the counts,
using natural spline terms for GC content. You may not have seen the
use of spline terms in R, but it's really very simple, you just wrap
a covariate inside of a function like `ns()` and then include it in a
formula as you would any other variable. If you haven't seen the use
of `glm`, this is also very similar to `lm`, but you additionally
specify a distributional *family*, here the Poisson.

For the sample from batch 4, the model would look like this:

`library(splines)`

`fit4 <- glm(counts4 ~ ns(gc, knots=ks), family=poisson, data=df)`

where the knots are given by:

`ks <- c(.4,seq(from=.45,to=.55,by=.025),.6)`

(This choice of knots comes from previous exploratory data analysis of
this particular dataset.)

Finally, plot the log of the fitted values (see `fitted()`) for the
three models, over the GC content. You can focus on the plot on the
range [0.35, 0.65]. You should end up with three curves
on the same plot. Alternatively, if you've done this before, you could
use `predict()` to extrapolate the curves on `newdata` (if this
doesn't make sense then use `fitted()`).

Which of the three experiments has an upward sloping dependence of
counts on gene GC content from the range 0.4 to 0.55?

# Question 2 - Modeling of bias using Conditional Quantile Normalization (CQN)

In the previous question, we ignored gene length, and simply modeled
gene count on the GC content of the gene. In this question we
will use CQN, as in `batch.Rmd` which includes modeling improvements
over the approach above, including fitting the relationship to GC
content and gene length simultaneously. 

Fit a `cqn` model to the counts in `assay(bottomly)` (the object
prepared at the end of the given code 
chunk above), using the GC content and gene length that you
calculated in problem 1. Then use `cqnplot` with `n=1` and then `n=2`
to draw the GC content and gene length dependence plots. Ignore the
warning (if you see this) about `use of 'sig2' is deprecated`.

Color the lines in the CQN plots using `bottomly$batch`. For the
GC content plot, use `xlim=c(.35,.65)`, and for the length plot use
`xlim=c(-2,5)`.

Which batch deviates from the other two in the dependence on GC
content? Does this match what we saw in `sva.Rmd` using the SVA
method to identify technical biases? Is there a single sample from one
of the other groups that shows up with the outlier group? Is this also
the same as we saw in `sva.Rmd`?

# Question 3 - Recovering known batch using Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA)

Finally, we will run SVA to find hidden batches, but we will use a dataset
where we know the batches: the GEUVADIS dataset from `batch.Rmd` and
previous distance lectures. By attempting a method on a dataset where
the technical batches are known, we can confirm that the method can
recover meaningful *surrogate variables*.

We begin by loading the `geuvadis.rda` object prepared in
`distances.Rmd`. We remove the YRI samples, as these have an outlier
sample that disrupts the SVA analysis. We then subset to 100 samples
randomly, and drop any factor levels that are now missing samples. 

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
library(magrittr)
load("geuvadis.rda")
dds <- dds[,dds$population != "YRI"]
table(dds$population, dds$center)
set.seed(1)
idx <- sample(ncol(dds), 100)
dds <- dds[,idx]
dds$population %<>% droplevels
dds$center %<>% droplevels
table(dds$population, dds$center)
```

As in `sva.Rmd`, you should run `sva` with `n.sv=2` on the normalized
counts in `dds`, using a full model of `~population` and a reduced
model of `~1`. This should take ~30 seconds or less.

Then, make a plot using ggplot2 of surrogate variables 1 and 2, with
the `center` indicated by color and the `population` indicated by
shape. By definition, the surrogate variables will not be associated
with population, because this was provided in the full model. Did the
two surrogate variables capture some variation associated with
sequencing center?
