We showed in the section on [batch effects](batch.html), that we can
sometimes identify the source of batch effects, and by using
statistical models, we can remove any sample-specific variation we can
predict based on features like sequence content or gene length. Here
we will show a powerful procedure, which doesn't require the use of
knowing exactly how the counts will vary across batches -- it uses
only the biological condition, and looks for large scale variation
which is orthogonal to the biological condition. This approach (we
will examine a specific method called surrogate variable analysis, or
SVA), does require that the technical variation be orthogonal to the
biological conditions.

For the description of the SVA method, see these two papers:

* [Capturing Heterogeneity in Gene Expression Studies by Surrogate Variable Analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1994707/)
* [svaseq: removing batch effects and other unwanted noise from sequencing data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4245966/)

Other methods which can identify hidden batches are described in these papers:

* [Normalization of RNA-seq data using factor analysis of control genes or samples](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404308/)
* [Using probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) to obtain increased power and interpretability of gene expression analyses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398141/)

We start by downloading RNA-seq count tables from the original 
[recount](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/)
project:

```{r}
url <- "http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/countTables/bottomly_count_table.txt"
file <- "bottomly_count_table.txt"
if (!file.exists(file)) download.file(url, file)
url <- "http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/phenotypeTables/bottomly_phenodata.txt"
file <- "bottomly_phenodata.txt"
if (!file.exists(file)) download.file(url, file)
```

This experiment consisted of 10 and 11 mice of two different
strains. But useful for our demonstration of SVA, it is key that the
experiment was performed in three batches. We will pretend in the
following code that we *do not know the batches*, although we do. We
will estimate technical variation using only the information about
which mouse is of which strain.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
cts <- read.table("bottomly_count_table.txt", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
coldata <- read.table("bottomly_phenodata.txt", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
all(colnames(cts) == rownames(coldata))
coldata$strain %<>% (function(x) sub("/",".",x))
coldata$strain %<>% factor
```

We use DESeq2 to produce a normalized count matrix, which is the input
to SVA. Note that the biological groups (mouse strain) were present
in all batches, so a block design. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(cts, coldata, ~strain)
dds$batch <- factor(dds$experiment.number)
table(dds$strain, dds$batch)
```

We estimate the library size correction and save the normalized counts
matrix: 

```{r}
dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)
norm.cts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)
```

Finally, we provide the normalized counts and two model matrices to
SVA. The first matrix uses the biological condition, and the second
model matrix is the null model, here just an intercept term.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(sva)
mm <- model.matrix(~ strain, colData(dds))
mm0 <- model.matrix(~ 1, colData(dds))
norm.cts <- norm.cts[rowSums(norm.cts) > 0,]
fit <- svaseq(norm.cts, mod=mm, mod0=mm0, n.sv=2)
```

If we plot the estimated *surrogate variables*, we see they separate
the samples from different batches fairly well. This procedure can be
used to estimate unknown, or undocumented batches present in
high-throughput datasets, although we must be careful not to overfit
and remove *too much* of the variation in the data -- some of which
represents natural biological variations of samples.

```{r message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library(rafalib)
bigpar()
dds$strain.int <- as.integer(dds$strain) + 15
plot(fit$sv[,1:2], col=dds$batch, pch=dds$strain.int, cex=2,
     xlab="SV1", ylab="SV2")
legend("top", levels(dds$batch), pch=16,
       col=1:3, cex=.8, ncol=3, title="batch")
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
